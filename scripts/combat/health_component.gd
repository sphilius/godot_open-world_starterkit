## Reusable health pool. Add it as a child of anything that can be hurt.
##
## Hitboxes resolve it from what they touched (a Hurtbox, or a body with a HealthComponent
## child) via HealthComponent.resolve(), then call take_damage(). Owners react through signals:
## `damaged` for stagger or flash, `died` for death.

signal damaged(hit: HitInfo)
signal health_changed(current: float, maximum: float)
signal died(hit: HitInfo)
